# Bibliotheek-Enum
Bibliotheek-Enum contains a Razor Page solution using enum for dropdownlist

I want to use dropdownlists using enum in ASP.NET Razor Pages. 
I am facing issues and cannot get them solved. 
Hard to debug finding the cause of the error InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Int32'.
